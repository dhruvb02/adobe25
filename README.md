Adobe Hackathon 2025 ‚Äì Intelligent PDF Analysis
Overview
This repository presents a dual-system solution developed for Adobe Hackathon 2025. The goal is to enable intelligent understanding and navigation of complex PDF documents using lightweight, offline-compatible tools.

The project is divided into two interconnected but standalone modules:

Challenge	Folder	Purpose
1A	challenge1a/	Extracts a structured outline (H1, H2, H3) from multilingual PDFs
1B	challenge1b/	Extracts and ranks content sections based on a user's persona and goal
Together, they provide an end-to-end document intelligence pipeline suitable for researchers, analysts, and developers working with large or unstructured PDF files.

Challenge 1A ‚Äì Hybrid Outline Extractor
Objective: Extract document structure by detecting and classifying headings (H1, H2, H3) from PDFs, even when multilingual or poorly formatted.

How It Works
Visual Features: Analyzes font size, boldness, underline, alignment, and capitalization.
Language Signals: Detects heading-like phrases using multilingual keywords (supports English, Hindi, Japanese, Spanish, French).
Hybrid Scoring System: Assigns heading levels based on both visual layout and linguistic patterns.
Hierarchy Construction: Groups extracted headings into a nested structure, forming an outline.
Fallback Logic: Ensures useful output even from noisy or unstructured PDFs.
Output
Each input PDF produces a JSON file containing:

Document title (inferred from metadata or visual cues)
Structured heading outline with H1‚ÄìH3 levels
Formatting metadata (page, size, bold, alignment, etc.)
Useful for processing academic papers, resumes, reports, and scanned PDFs with embedded text.

Challenge 1B ‚Äì Persona-Based Section Extractor
Objective: Extract and summarize the most relevant sections from one or more PDFs based on a defined persona and their task or objective.

How It Works
Reads user input from a persona.json file describing role and intent.

Parses PDFs to identify candidate sections.

Computes TF-IDF similarity between sections and persona/task.

Boosts ranking using pre-defined domain keywords (e.g., ‚Äúmethodology,‚Äù ‚Äúbenchmark,‚Äù ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù).

Generates a structured JSON output with:

Ranked relevant sections
Key keywords
Concise summaries
Page references and source context
Output
For each run, produces a single JSON result file with:

Input metadata (files, persona, timestamp)
Scored and ranked sections
Summary sentences from each section
Keywords and page-level metadata
Subsections with refined extracted highlights
Ideal for literature reviews, grant preparation, policy analysis, or industry research.

Why Our Models Stand Out
Feature	Common Solutions	Our Models
Multilingual PDF Support	Rare or incomplete	Full support for English, Hindi, French, Japanese, etc.
Hybrid Scoring	Usually layout-based only	Combines layout, text patterns, and semantic cues
Heading Hierarchy	Often flat or shallow	Nested H1‚ÄìH3 output with contextual relevance
Persona Adaptability	Not supported	Customizable persona-specific section ranking
Lightweight & Offline	Many depend on external APIs or models	Fully offline after Docker build, <100MB memory use
Resilience on Poor PDFs	Prone to failure	Uses fallback logic to ensure partial useful output

üöÄ Getting Started
Each module is containerized via Docker and can be run independently.

Run Challenge 1A: Outline Extractor
cd challenge1a
docker build -t pdf-outline-extractor .
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  pdf-outline-extractor
Run Challenge 1B: Persona-Based Extractor
cd challenge1b
docker build -t persona-extractor .
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  -v "$(pwd)/persona.json:/app/persona.json" \
  persona-extractor
On Windows (PowerShell), replace $(pwd) with $(Get-Location).

Summary
This repository demonstrates a two-part solution that bridges the gap between document structure (Challenge 1A) and semantic meaning (Challenge 1B).

It is designed to operate efficiently and reliably across real-world documents, including multilingual and semi-structured PDFs. By focusing on hybrid scoring, offline usability, and modular design, this tool offers a robust framework for intelligent document processing‚Äîadaptable for industry, academia, and enterprise applications.
